## In a markdown file, explain JavaScript DOM


Javascript relates with DOM using three types of nodes, the Element node (Head), the text node(houses my title) and the attribute node.

Each rectangular boxes in the DOM tress are objects which thus makes it easy for javascript to communicate with the DOM.

Website creation is dependeent on three aspect which are HTML, CSS, & Javascript.

## HTML(Hypertext MarkUp Language)
This is known used in displaying words and different types of data in a a documented form.infact the representration of these data are not so interactive to work with.

## CSS (Cascading style sheet)
We call it the presentation module, it gives the html document structure and interactive data to work with, here colours are added, padding and margin are given to the webpages, and so many transformations are done to give the webdesign pages a beffiting look.

## JAVASCRIPT
This is a scripting language that is used to make the website page a functional,interactive and dynamic one.it is an object oriented programming language.

The story of **DOM(document Object Model)** came to existence because that is the only language by which javascript can communicate with an HTML document.For Javascript to perform its functional role in website design application.The only route of communication language javascript can work with is through the DOM.

## What is DOM?
DOM is referred to as Document Object Model, it has an hierarachy of HTML(which is divided into the head and body), through these head and body, javascript interacts with their nodes, which we can call objects. we have three types of nodes, these are Element Node(this exist within the head tag), we have the text node and the attribute node(it exists within the body div tag).

Javascript effectively performs its functions by acessing these aforementioned object or nodes types.

lastly, the DOM is a very important model when it comes to website development,Design and application, because it is the only channel that the Javascript can be meaninglyful and effective.

**Addendum:** I have a Jpeg file attached to the md file, which highlights further details on how the DOM operates
