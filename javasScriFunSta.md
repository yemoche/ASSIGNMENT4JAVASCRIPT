# Explain JavaScript statements with example

Javascript statement are instructions that makes javascript functional(i.e they give sequential instructions on how task are to be carried out). they are could be series of words or clauses.some of these statements are used finds their application of use in algorithm case study, when you are trying to solve a problem from the basic to the advanced software creation. without these statements, solving problem through coding & programming would have been a sheer waste of time.without statement, programming & coding will be shapeless and meaningless.

Some examples of javascript statements are the for loop statement, if...else if...else statement, Break, Switch case, Continue, comment,etc.

Quoting from MDN documentation, they divided statements into various types such Iterations (do...while,for, and so on), Functions and classes(return, class, and so on), Declarations (let,const, and so on) and control flow (Block,continue,and so on).


# Explain JavaScript expressions with example

A Javascript expression is said to be a unit or snippet of code that evaluates and returns a value.
we have different types of Javascript expressions, such as Arithmetric expressions (1/2,i*2,i++,e.t.c), string expressions ('B', "Cassava", etc), Primary expressions or literal ( 2, 0.02,true),Array & Object initializers expressions([],{}, [1,2,9]),Logical expressions(a && b, a || b, !a), left-hamd-side expressions(new, super,etc), property access expressions(object.property,object[property],etc),Object creation expressions (new object(), new calccet(1),etc), function expressions(function(){},window.resize())


# What is the difference between statements/expressions? (use table in markdown to differentiate these )

**Expression :** it is a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value.

expressions does not depend on statement.




**Statement :** this is a standalone unit of exceution and doesnt return anything.

A statement is embedded with an expressions.





# Explain JavaScript functions in your own words

Javascript functions are simply a body of object variables whose role is to simplify computer programming processes and avoid long range of repeated codes.
Javascript functions could be inbuilt or user defined (UDF), some of the inbuilt funtions in Javascript are mathfloor, setMonth, SQRT2, PI, etc). examples of custom defined functions (factorial, square root,etc).

A javascript function could be named function block, immediate invoked types and annoymous we can have a function called in another function (closure) or recursive in nature(that is when a function calls itself).

## Some fundamental things to know about functions are:

1.They must be reusable
2.They should have only one responsibility
3.They should be descriptive, timeless and straight to the point...making use of the right name, ensuring the annonymous function is initiated with a name, and so on.
